    This document outlines the recommended workflow for training your model using self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques. 
    1. Begin by pretraining your model with the `lightly_train` method, which leverages SSL to learn useful representations from unlabeled data.
    2. Once pretraining is complete, proceed to fine-tune the pretrained model using the Ultralytics library. This step adapts the model for your specific downstream task, such as classification, detection, or segmentation.
    Following this two-stage process can improve model performance, especially when labeled data is limited.

First, pretrain your model using self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques by lightly_train. After pretraining, fine-tune the model using the Ultralytics library for your specific downstream task.
